	* src/cmd2.c: "Easy open" ignores broken doors now when trying to
	close doors.

2004-01-31 11:49  rr9

	* src/dungeon.c: Removed commented out code.

2004-01-31 11:48  rr9

	* src/main-ros.c: Use string copy instead of format strings.

2004-01-30 19:39  rr9

	* src/util.c: Don't use format strings when a simple string copy is
	enough.

2004-01-30 19:24  rr9

	* src/externs.h: Corrected an outdated comment.

2004-01-29 09:03  rr9

	* src/files.c: Removed a silly use of a format string.

2004-01-28 23:56  rr9

	* src/main-win.c: Cleaned up the code a bit.

2004-01-28 23:26  rr9

	* src/main-win.c: Added transparency support to the 32x32 tiles in
	the Windows port.  This requires the modified tiles bitmap and the
	new transparency mask from Andrew Doull's UnAngband:
	http://download.berlios.de/unangband/dvg32x32-1.0.zip

2004-01-28 21:14  rr9

	* src/: tables.c, cmd5.c, externs.h: Smoothed out the table for the
	INT/WIS dependent failure rate adjustment.

2004-01-27 23:40  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, tables.c, xtra1.c: Smoothed out the "spells per
	level" vs. "spell stat" table.

2004-01-27 22:31  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, tables.c, xtra1.c: Smoothed out the table
	containing the hitpoint bonus from constitution.

2004-01-27 20:25  rr9

	* src/store.c: Only display the "avg" info for prices in stores if
	the charges of wands or staves can't be distributed evenly.

2004-01-27 20:22  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, tables.c, xtra1.c: Smoothed out the table of
	extra mana-points per level.  The old steps at INT/WIS 8, 9, 18/50,
	and 18/70 have been replaced by a steady increase.

2004-01-25 15:45  rr9

	* lib/edit/ego_item.txt: Describe ego items with special names but
	without special abilities, so players need not wonder what the
	names mean: Launchers of Accuracy and Power, ammo of Wounding,
	gloves of Slaying. (Hallvard B Furuseth)

2004-01-25 15:44  rr9

	* lib/edit/object.txt: Added object descriptions assembled by
	Hallvard B Furuseth.
	
	The descriptions are mostly copied from obj-long.spo version 3.0.2
	by Hugo Kornelis, Stephen S. Lee, Leonard Dickens and Craig Lewis.

2004-01-25 15:36  rr9

	* lib/edit/artifact.txt: Artifact changes by Jonathan Ellis: -
	Added artifact descriptions.  The texts are mainly taken from
	OAngband and other variants.  - Gave the 'thanc daggers a 2d4
	damage dice instead of 1d4.  - Gave each of the Paur* gauntlets a
	single minor power (slow-digestion, regeneration, permanent light,
	feather fall).	- Made the 'thanc daggers and paur* gauntlets more
	common.

2004-01-25 15:27  rr9

	* src/obj-info.c: Various bugfixes and improvements to the object
	description code. (Hallvard B Furuseth)

2004-01-25 14:54  rr9

	* src/: birth.c, cmd3.c, dungeon.c, object2.c, spells2.c: Fixed
	various comments concerning the "known" and "aware" status of
	items.	(Hallvard B Furuseth)

2004-01-17 20:15  rr9

	* src/: obj-info.c, randart.c: Display artifact and ego-item
	descriptions when available.  Note that randomized artifacts can't
	keep the description from the original artifact.

2004-01-17 19:52  rr9

	* src/init1.c: Added support for artifact and ego-item descriptions
	to the lib/edit/*.txt file parser.

2004-01-17 16:08  rr9

	* src/obj-info.c: Show the object description for flavored items
	(rings, wands, potions, ...) only if the player is aware of the
	item.

2004-01-17 12:05  rr9

	* lib/edit/ego_item.txt: Removed fire brand from ammo 'of Holy
	Might'.  Also removed the BLESSED flag that doesn't have a function
	on ammo. (Timo Pietilä)

2004-01-17 11:58  rr9

	* lib/edit/ego_item.txt: Heavy crossbows no longer can get the 'of
	the Haradrim' suffix and 'light crossbows of the Haradrim' get a
	smaller damage bonus. (Timo Pietilä)

2004-01-17 11:37  rr9

	* lib/edit/object.txt: Made Raal's Tome of Destruction more, and
	Kelek's Grimoire of Power less common. (Timo Pietilä)

2004-01-17 11:33  rr9

	* lib/edit/object.txt: Rods of Recall, Perception, Curing, Healing,
	Restoration, and Speed will not be destroyed by electricity.

2004-01-10 13:15  rr9

	* src/init2.c: Allow initialization of the game to continue, even
	if the lib/data/*.raw files can't be written.  In that case the
	data parsed from the lib/edit/*.txt files stays in memory and is
	used instead of the *.raw data.  This currently wastes some memory,
	since the text arrays are not resized to the minimum required
	length.
	
	This is the first step toward a secure, non-setgid installation on
	multi- user systems.

2004-01-02 15:14  rr9

	* src/script.c: Use the Lua 5 function names instead of the Lua 4
	ones.

2004-01-02 15:09  rr9

	* src/main-crb.c: - Restored (superfluous) "pascal" keyword in some
	places because some compilers complain about it.  - Shortened
	event-checking interval from six ticks to one, as the old value
	caused gawky screen updates.  ("pelpel")

2004-01-02 15:08  rr9

	* src/Makefile.osx: Removed a superfluous #define. It now uses
	"-O2" optimisation. ("pelpel")

2004-01-02 14:58  rr9

	* lib/pref/graf-mac.prf: The Mac OS X port can make use of David
	Gervais' tiles. ("pelpel")

2004-01-02 14:57  rr9

	* lib/pref/font-mac.prf: The old 2.7.9--2.8.1 colours look better
	on the Macintosh. ("pelpel")

2004-01-02 14:46  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua: angband.object_desc requires an integer
	value for the second argument.	("pelpel")

2004-01-02 09:42  rr9

	* src/init2.c: Fixed a wrong (but mostly harmless) #ifdef.

2004-01-01 16:00  rr9

	* src/init.h: Make the list of exported headers in init.h
	consistent with the one in init2.c. (Kieron)

2003-12-31 19:40  rr9

	* src/script.c: Remove the error handler function from the stack
	after calling a Lua event handler.  Otherwise the Lua stack grows
	every turn, eating memory and performance.

2003-12-31 17:42  rr9

	* src/files.c: The *.prf file parser will now ignore unknown
	options (like the removed 'auto_haggle' option).

2003-12-31 13:27  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua: Added various missing library prefixes
	missing since the introduction of Lua 5. ("pelpel")

2003-12-31 13:22  rr9

	* src/use-obj.c: Correctly drain the charge of a stack of rods in
	the non-Lua version.  ("pelpel")

2003-12-31 13:10  rr9

	* lib/script/event.lua: Returning values from scripts was broken
	when the first of multiple return values was false.  This could
	happen when using objects that were not identified by using them.
	(reported by "pelpel")

2003-12-30 12:34  rr9

	* src/script.c: The player started without food and torches when
	USE_SCRIPT was turned off.  (reported by "pelpel")

2003-12-23 20:48  rr9

	* src/birth.c: Allow the left and right cursor keys to navigate
	back and forth in the character birth menu (Andrew Sidwell).

2003-12-22 18:18  rr9

	* src/melee2.c: The previous patch didn't cover the case where
	smart_monsters is turned on too.

2003-12-22 17:56  rr9

	* src/melee2.c: Monster groups ignored their fear when the
	smart_packs option was turned on. (reported by Eddie Grove)

2003-12-21 21:34  rr9

	* src/files.c: Added the equipment flag matrix to the character
	dump.

2003-11-23 18:41  rr9

	* lib/edit/shop_own.txt, src/init1.c, src/store.c, src/types.h: We
	only need one "greed" value for shopkeepers now, since we no longer
	have separate values for the first and for the final offer. 
	(noticed by Andrew Sidwell)

2003-11-23 15:58  rr9

	* lib/edit/object.txt: Junk items like broken sticks, empty
	bottles, and rodent skeletons are no longer generated in the
	dungeon.

2003-11-23 15:25  rr9

	* lib/edit/shop_own.txt, lib/help/dungeon.txt,
	lib/help/general.txt, lib/help/option.txt, src/defines.h,
	src/init1.c, src/l-object.pkg, src/load.c, src/save.c, src/store.c,
	src/tables.c, src/types.h: Removed the old haggling code.  The
	auto-haggling code is now permanently active and will give the
	normal price of items without the 10% "sales tax".

2003-11-22 21:19  rr9

	* src/: init2.c, script.c, types.h: Put the old "pure C"
	implementation of the store code back in to allow the game to
	compile with scripting support turned off.

2003-11-22 12:51  rr9

	* lib/edit/monster.txt: Fixed a typo in the description of the
	"wild cat". (reported by Jay McAbee)

2003-11-13 22:07  rr9

	* src/lua/tolua.c: Switched "tolua" to using precompiled code
	instead of the Lua code to work around path separator troubles on
	RISC OS.

2003-11-13 21:00  rr9

	* src/lua/ltable.c: Rollback of the recent "const" changes. 
	Replace them with Pelpel's patch.

2003-10-29 21:10  rr9

	* src/lua/ltable.c: Try to fix some "const"-problems in the Lua
	source reported by "pelpel".

2003-10-29 21:00  rr9

	* src/lua/tolua.c: Mac specific fix by "pelpel": tolua assumed the
	host environment is either Unix or DOS/Windows, by hard- coding '/'
	and '\' path separators.

2003-10-04 19:49  rr9

	* src/util.c: Fixed potential buffer overflow bugs in the recently
	added trigger_ascii_to_text() and trigger_test_to_ascii()
	functions.

2003-10-04 19:45  rr9

	* src/: z-form.c, z-form.h: Added ZAngband's strnfcat() function
	for efficiently appending a formatted string to another string.

2003-10-03 19:20  rr9

	* src/lua/: lbaselib.c, lgc.h, liolib.c, lparser.c, lvm.c, ldo.c,
	lgc.c, lua.h: Added the patches from the Lua 5.0.1 bugfix version.

2003-10-03 12:32  rr9

	* src/spells1.c: Added a level dependent chance to resist the
	teleportation effect of gravity attacks for monsters and the
	player. (suggested by Jonathan Ellis)

2003-09-07 15:02  rr9

	* src/spells1.c: Give the short range teleport effect from gravity
	attacks on monsters an additional 1 in 3 chance to teleport the
	monster away.  This should make abusing the Rift spell a bit
	harder.

2003-09-04 21:11  rr9

	* src/birth.c: Resolved an "unreachable code" warning.

2003-09-04 21:09  rr9

	* src/obj-info.c: No need to KILL(), FREE() is enough.

2003-09-04 21:07  rr9

	* src/Makefile.bcc: The Borland command line tools compiler needs
	'\' instead of '/' for paths.

2003-09-04 21:05  rr9

	* src/birth.c: The function get_player_race() doesn't take any
	parameters.

2003-09-04 21:04  rr9

	* src/spells1.c: Include scripts.h for the event handler prototype.

2003-09-04 21:02  rr9

	* src/: Makefile.cyg, Makefile.gtk, Makefile.lsl, Makefile.osx:
	Removed the dependency on the no longer existing "lua/luadebug.h"
	header.

2003-08-30 13:26  rr9

	* src/l-monst.pkg: Fixed the "monster_desc" function and added
	"mon_list" to the list of variables exported to Lua.

2003-08-30 12:31  rr9

	* src/: script.c, script.h, spells1.c: Trigger a Lua event when the
	player is hit by a beam/bolt/ball attack.

2003-08-30 11:17  rr9

	* src/spells1.c: Removed an useless and confusing variable alias.

2003-08-27 22:32  rr9

	* src/script.c: Use dummy functions for the new event handlers when
	scripting is turned off.

2003-08-27 22:21  rr9

	* lib/script/Makefile.am, lib/script/init.lua,
	lib/script/player.lua, src/dungeon.c: Moved the handling of damage
	from lingering poison to a Lua script.
	
	Note: The handling of the *initial* poison damage is not yet done
	in Lua.

2003-08-27 20:58  rr9

	* lib/script/event.lua: Added an utility function that waits for a
	given number of event calls before resuming the execution of an
	event-handler coroutine.

2003-08-27 20:31  rr9

	* src/: dungeon.c, script.c, script.h: Added two more Lua events.
	"game_turn" is triggered every game turn, while "process_world" is
	only activated every 10 game turns.

2003-08-27 14:20  rr9

	* src/: dungeon.c, script.c, script.h: Added a new Lua event that
	is triggered when the player gets a turn.

2003-08-27 14:17  rr9

	* src/util.c: Improved the handling of incomplete '\x' sequences in
	macros.  The old code could skip the final NUL-byte of the string
	if it ended with '\x', leading to a potential buffer overflow.

2003-08-15 20:40  rr9

	* src/util.c: text_to_ascii() didn't check that the characters used
	in \xAB sequences represent real hex characters.  Invalid hex
	sequences are now converted to the '?' character.  (problem
	reported by Kieron Dunbar)

2003-08-15 18:56  rr9

	* lib/script/birth.lua: Lua uses 1-based arrays, so don't forget to
	add '+1' to indices to 0-based C-arrays. (reported by "Darkgod")

2003-08-10 18:08  rr9

	* src/h-define.h: Removed the old pre-ANSI definition of NULL.
	(Andrew Sidwell)

2003-08-10 18:02  rr9

	* src/: h-define.h, main-x11.c, main-xpj.c, z-util.c: The
	FORCEUPPER() and FORCELOWER() macros are just silly wrappers around
	toupper() and tolower() and have been removed.	(Andrew Sidwell)

2003-08-10 14:25  rr9

	* lib/: pref/graf-xxx.prf, xtra/graf/8x8.bmp: Added new 8x8 tiles
	and tile definitions provided by "Dawnmist".
	
	Changes: - New tiles added for new monsters.  - Piles of objects
	now have a tile.  - All items, monsters, and floor features ought
	to have graphics.

2003-08-10 12:52  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, l-player.pkg, spells1.c: Changed the 'permanent'
	argument of dec_stat() to boolean.

2003-08-10 12:39  rr9

	* Makefile.am: We don't need 'acconfig.h' anymore.

2003-08-10 12:22  rr9

	* src/l-spell.pkg: Removed duplicated definitions of some Lua
	bindings.

2003-07-27 19:03  rr9

	* src/: main-crb.c, main-mac.c: Applied "pelpel's" latest Mac
	patches:
	
	* common to main-crb.c and main-mac.c (1) The update event handler
	now respects update region.  (2) Changed the way the program finds
	term_data to use refcon (a Mac idiom) (3) play_game() is now
	entered from a single point in main() to make	  those file menu
	handlers much less hackish, but slightly complicating	  main(). 
	It might be possible to use main.c if we pursued this direction    
	further.  (4) The old synchronous sound player is pulled out of
	Term_xtra to make its	  interface same as that of asynchronous
	one.  (5) Unified colour table code for TERM_XTRA and game
	initialisation.  * main-crb.c (6) Reorganised the initialisation
	code in main() to follow more conventional     order.  * main-mac.c
	(7) Removed "ifdef ZANGBAND" from the new use_graphics/arg_graphics
	code,	  because it is no longer specific to [Z].  (8) Unified
	preferences location code for loading and saving.

2003-07-27 18:58  rr9

	* src/: cave.c, externs.h: Removed a compiler warning in the new
	'use_graphics' code. (reported by Jordan Hobbs)

2003-07-13 19:02  rr9

	* src/: cave.c, externs.h, main-ami.c, main-crb.c, main-ibm.c,
	main-mac.c, main-x11.c, main-xaw.c, main-xpj.c, variable.c: Tried
	to clean up the use of use_graphics and the code for the floor and
	wall lighting effects.	'use_graphics' is now an integer and should
	contain one of the GRAPHICS_* #defines instead of a boolean
	TRUE/FALSE value.
	
	Note: This change is untested on many platforms.  Please report
	failure or success with the various main-*.c files.

2003-07-13 17:09  rr9

	* src/main-gcu.c: Change colors in main-gcu.c.	This is Dominik
	Grzelak's patch to change bright white from blue back to bright
	white. (taken from Ed Cogburn's set of patches)

2003-07-13 10:40  rr9

	* src/util.c: Improved the output of item and monster descriptions
	in spoilers and character dumps.  In some cases punctuation and
	spaces were wrapped to the next line.

2003-07-11 09:55  rr9

	* src/spells2.c: Recharging wands or staves that have been fully
	*identified* before will now automatically reveal the new number of
	charges in the device.
	
	This fixes a bug where an already *ID'ed* wand or staff couldn't be
	*ID'ed* again after recharging (but plain ID works), despite the
	number of charges being unknown. (bug reported by Eddie Grove)

2003-07-09 22:25  rr9

	* src/files.c: Added the player's maximum depth in the dungeon to
	the character display and the dump.

2003-07-09 18:37  rr9

	* src/: main-mac.c, main-crb.c: More Mac specific patches by
	"pelpel": (1) main-mac.c: A typo:
	NewAEEventHanderUPP->NewAEEventHandlerUPP (2) Navigation services
	dialog in main-crb.c and the alternative code (off by default) in
	main-mac.c: A program should never try to free NULL.H (3) Players
	had to be able to use numpad for places like the autoroller.

2003-07-05 15:53  rr9

	* src/: main-crb.c, main-mac.c: Mac bugfix by "pelpel":
	
	(main-crb.c, main-mac.c) - Reopen Application AppleEvent handler
	called term_data_link	with a wrong parameter.

2003-07-05 15:50  rr9

	* src/: main-crb.c, main-mac.c: Mac patches by "pelpel": * both (1)
	The volume command used wrong number of bits to set volume levels
	of     left and right channels.  * main-crb.c (2) Re-introduced the
	'six tick hack' to CheckEvents() in response to     the slow
	autoroller problem reported by Arcum Dagsson.  * main-mac.c (3)
	Disabled USE_NAVIGATION_SERVICE by default at suggestion by Ken
	Dubuc,	   because it unnecessarily narrows compatibility down. 
	(4) Term_pict_mac didn't advance x coordinate appropriately (a
	wrong cleanup	  attempt) (5) Some explanations on why 'old' ports
	ceased to work.  It was basically     a library problem, or an old
	port needs old development systems.

2003-05-11 17:16  rr9

	* TODO: Updated the ToDo list.

2003-05-11 17:05  rr9

	* TODO, lib/edit/object.txt, lib/script/object.lua, src/cmd2.c,
	src/cmd3.c, src/cmd6.c, src/dungeon.c, src/externs.h, src/load.c,
	src/melee1.c, src/object1.c, src/object2.c, src/spells1.c,
	src/spells2.c, src/store.c, src/use-obj.c: Rods, wands, and staves
	with different charges can now be stacked.  This implementation is
	based on the NPPAngband version that in turn is based on Leon
	Marrick's rod/wand stacking in OAngband.  Besides the stacking this
	change also modifies rods so that they can't be recharged anymore,
	and that they are vulnerable to electricity.

2003-04-20 15:58  rr9

	* lib/help/help.hlp, src/files.c: Changed the meaning of the keys
	used for navigation in the help files.	The number and cursor keys
	can no be used for scrolling, letters select the corresponding menu
	entry, the ESC key returns you to the previous page and '?' leaves
	the help system completely.  Commands for jumping to the start and
	the end of the file have been added.
	
	The scrolling has been changed so that scrolling stops when the
	last line of the file is in view instead of starting again from the
	beginning of the file.	The line numbers of the visible area are
	now displayed as a range in addition to the total number of lines. 
	This makes it easier to notice that you reached the end of the
	file.

2003-04-13 17:55  rr9

	* src/script.c: minor code cleanup

2003-04-12 15:09  rr9

	* src/: main-crb.c, main-mac.c: Applied pelpel's latest Mac patch. 
	The changes are: * main-mac.c  - Restored 'pascal' keyword to the
	definitions of AppleEvent handlers.   - Restored ancient
	GetNextEvent() API, because it works better with     the autoroller
	and the running code...  * main-crb.c  - SegLoad.h is 68K-specific
	and shouldn't have been in Carbon source code.	 - Added missing
	#include <Processes.h>	* common to main-mac.c and main-crb.c  -
	Added support for the fifth required AppleEvent, Re-open
	Application,	that was introduced by Mac OS 8.   - Replaced HLock
	used by the sound code with HLockHi, to prevent     memory
	fragmentation under Classic   - Renamed some #include's with new
	names, to avoid conflict with	  POSIX header names.	- Removed a
	wrong cast for the sound volume command.   - Updated some comments

2003-03-22 14:31  rr9

	* src/main-x11.c: Don't print an error message when receiving an
	unknown selection request.

2003-03-21 21:53  rr9

	* src/: cave.c, defines.h, dungeon.c, externs.h, monster2.c,
	tables.c, xtra1.c, xtra2.c: - Added John Rauser's monster list
	patch that allows the user to display a list of the visible
	monsters in a window.  - Added support for bigtile mode to the
	patch.

2003-03-21 19:34  rr9

	* src/main-x11.c: Allow text to be copied from the game window in
	the X11 port. (modified version of the code in Kieron Dunbar's
	sCthangband 1.0.10)

2003-03-14 21:09  rr9

	* src/main-gtk.c: Angband consumed 100% of the cpu while waiting
	for a keypress in the GTK port.  This happened because the
	CheckEvent() function in the main-gtk.c file didn't respect the
	wait parameter it was given. (Sheldon Simms)

2003-03-14 20:59  rr9

	* lib/pref/: pref-gtk.prf, pref.prf: The GTK port uses the same key
	definitions and default macros as the normal X11 ports.

2003-03-05 22:40  rr9

	* lib/help/birth.txt: Fixed a typo.

2003-02-28 17:34  rr9

	* src/: cmd1.c, cmd2.c, config.h, externs.h, object1.c, xtra2.c:
	Removed the #ifdef's for the ALLOW_EASY_* options.

2003-02-28 12:13  rr9

	* src/main-gcu.c: Added a workaround for a bug when using
	USE_GETCH.  The news.txt screen was erased by the first call to the
	getch() function.  (Frank Palazzolo)

2003-02-28 11:54  rr9

	* src/Makefile.osx: Added a Makefile for the Mac OS X Carbon port.
	(submitted by "pelpel")

2003-02-28 11:48  rr9

	* src/: main-crb.c, main-mac.c: More bugfixes and cleanup in the
	Mac ports. ("pelpel") Details: (1) Fixed the other uses of internal
	union members of the	 PBGetCatInfo* parameter block.  (2) Fixed
	some comments -- Mac OS version compabitility info and grammar. 
	(3) Some functions opened a file with fopen and closed it with	  
	my_fclose (main-mac.c only).

2003-02-28 11:35  rr9

	* lib/pref/pref-mac.prf: The key codes for F9 and F10 in
	pref-mac.prf were wrong. (Takeshi Mogami)

2003-02-27 22:43  rr9

	* src/util.c: Added the missing return value to the new
	macro_free() function.

2003-02-26 20:24  rr9

	* lib/pref/user.prf: Automatically try to load the "Kobold.prf"
	file at startup if the player is a Kobold.

2003-02-23 18:29  rr9

	* src/spells2.c: Prevent earthquake/destruction spells from working
	in town.  That is easier than fixing the spells so that no
	inappropriate messages (like "The cave ceiling collapses!") are
	displayed.

2003-02-23 17:57  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua, src/spells2.c, src/use-obj.c: Allow the
	banishment spell to be aborted at the "Choose a monster race to
	banish" prompt without using up a scroll or charge.

2003-02-23 17:50  rr9

	* src/script.c: Make compilation with USE_SCRIPT fail again, since
	the missing implementation of get_store_choice() will cause the
	game to hang otherwise.

2003-02-23 17:35  rr9

	* src/script.c: Added some dummy functions to make the game compile
	with the USE_SCRIPT option off.

2003-02-23 15:56  rr9

	* src/main-mac.c: Fixed a stupid bug in main-mac.c - a wrong
	structure was passed to the PBGetCatInfoSync() function. (Steve
	Sexton and "pelpel")

2003-02-23 15:53  rr9

	* src/main-crb.c: Fixed an annoying problem on OS X - messages were
	displayed in a wrong window if one brings the Angband application
	back by clicking on a subwindow. ("pelpel")

2003-02-23 13:15  rr9

	* src/cmd4.c: Fixed some hacky code. (Takeshi Mogami)

2003-02-23 11:56  rr9

	* src/cmd4.c: Changed the format of the pref-file dump headers and
	footers to allow detection of various invalid edits by the user. 
	The dump will be appended instead of replaced in such cases.

2003-02-22 23:04  rr9

	* src/cmd4.c: Added a stripped down version of Takeshi Mogami's
	"auto_dump" feature from Hengband.  Automatic pref file dumps from
	the game are now marked, so that they can be replaced when dumping
	to the same pref-file again.

2003-02-22 16:32  rr9

	* src/Makefile.mpw: Added a makefile for the Macintosh Programmer's
	Workshop. ("pelpel")

2003-02-22 13:19  rr9

	* src/: main-crb.c, main-mac.c: Added "pelpel's" latest Mac
	patches.

2003-02-22 13:14  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, init2.c, util.c: Moved the macro-freeing code to
	a seperate function.

2003-02-22 11:10  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, files.c, init2.c, util.c: Fixed a memory leak in
	the macro trigger implementation. (thanks to Mogami for pointing it
	out)

2003-02-21 17:58  rr9

	* src/main-win.c: Hopefully make the APWBorg screensaver work
	again. (Dr. Andrew White)

2003-02-20 20:46  rr9

	* src/lua/lapi.c: Fixed a bug with toggling garbage collection in
	Lua when using 64-bit longs. (patch by Roberto Ierusalimschy)

2003-02-16 22:44  rr9

	* lib/pref/pref-x11.prf: Changed some more macro triggers to the
	new style.

2003-02-16 22:43  rr9

	* src/birth.c: Select the sex, race, and class choices from a dead
	character as defaults for a new character.

2003-02-16 20:26  rr9

	* src/birth.c: Added a better character selection screen with
	support for using the cursor keys, display of info about the
	various race and class choices, and context sensitive help.  The
	code is based on the EyAngband's birth screen that again is
	probably based on ZAngband's birth screen, ...

2003-02-16 18:48  rr9

	* lib/help/birth.txt: Added tags for context sensitive help to the
	character birth documentation.

2003-02-16 14:50  rr9

	* lib/pref/pref-x11.prf: - The control-keypad key combinations work
	now with numlock on and off.  - Replaced some old triggers with
	new-style ones.

2003-02-16 14:22  rr9

	* lib/pref/pref-x11.prf: The cursor keys in the X11 ports behave
	the same way now, no matter if num-lock is on or off.

2003-02-16 13:24  rr9

	* lib/pref/pref-mac.prf, lib/pref/pref-win.prf,
	lib/pref/pref-x11.prf, src/defines.h, src/externs.h, src/files.c,
	src/util.c, src/variable.c, src/z-util.c, src/z-util.h: Added a
	modified version of Mogami's macro trigger patch.
	
	This patch modifies how macro trigger keys are displayed on screen
	and written in .prf files.  The trigger keys are no longer
	displayed in ugly key code style, such like ^__FFBE\r or
	^_O_FF53\r, but in more smart style, such like \[F1] or
	\[alt-Right].

2003-02-16 11:50  rr9

	* src/Makefile.am: Include the new Mac specific files in the source
	tarball.

2003-02-15 18:19  rr9

	* src/: config.h, defines.h, main.c, save.c: Removed some code that
	dealt with the AFS distributed filesystem.  The code was untested
	according to comments in the source and Google searches didn't turn
	up any documentation for the used AFS library functions.

2003-02-15 18:11  rr9

	* src/: config.h, load.c: Removed the compile time option to switch
	off the verification of savefile checksums.

2003-02-15 13:02  rr9

	* acconfig.h: Replaced the depracated acconfig.h template with use
	of the third argument 'AC_DEFINE' and 'AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED'.

2003-02-15 13:00  rr9

	* configure.in: [no log message]

2003-02-14 23:14  rr9

	* src/main-crb.c: Added the current Mac OS X front-end. ("pelpel")

2003-02-14 23:06  rr9

	* src/main-mac.c: Added the latest Mac front-end. ("pelpel")

2003-02-14 22:43  rr9

	* src/: config.h, externs.h, h-config.h, h-system.h, util.c,
	lua/ltable.c: - Applied the Mac specific patches from "pelpel's"
	ext-mac archive.  - Added "pelpel's" version of my_fgets() with
	support for different	end-of-line characters.

2003-02-14 22:37  rr9

	* src/main-xaw.c: Removed two compiler warnings.

2003-02-14 20:45  rr9

	* src/cmd4.c: Added the kill count of non-unique monsters to the
	knowledge menu.

2003-02-14 19:48  rr9

	* src/types.h: Removed an outdated "ToDo" comment.

2003-02-09 18:24  rr9

	* src/cmd3.c: Refilling a latern from a stack of laterns will now
	only remove the oil from one latern, instead from the whole stack.
	(bug reported by Jay McAbee)

2003-02-07 22:11  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, files.c: The display_scores() function was made
	static by accident.  It needs to be extern since it is used by
	other files.  (thanks to Kieron for pointing that out too)

2003-02-07 22:07  rr9

	* src/: Makefile.am, config.h: Accidently commited some local
	changes to include the Borg. (thanks to Kieron for pointing that
	out)

2003-02-07 19:08  rr9

	* src/cmd6.c: Fixed a comment that refered to the non-existant
	'rods of banishment'.  (John I'anson-Holton)

2003-02-07 19:02  rr9

	* src/: Makefile.am, cmd4.c, config.h: Removed a duplicated line.
	(John I'anson-Holton)

2003-02-06 21:21  rr9

	* src/: angband.rc, externs.h, files.c, main-win.c, variable.c:
	Removed the hackish 'Show scores' menu entry from the Windows
	version.  Use the new knowledge menu entry instead.

2003-02-05 22:34  rr9

	* src/: cmd4.c, files.c: Changed the wording for the scores display
	a bit.

2003-02-05 21:54  rr9

	* src/: cmd4.c, externs.h, files.c: Added a 'show scores' command
	to the knowledge menu.

2003-02-05 20:37  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua: Wands and rods of light don't give a
	message and aren't automatically identified when using them while
	you are blind.	(bug reported by Steve Kroon)

2003-02-05 20:33  rr9

	* src/spells1.c: The effects of light spells are only obvious if
	you aren't blind.

2003-02-05 20:17  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua: Rods and staves of probing were
	automatically identified by usage, even if no monster was probed. 
	(reported by "someog")

2003-02-05 19:30  rr9

	* src/util.c: Show all minor error messages immediately in the
	message window.

2003-02-05 18:54  rr9

	* src/spells1.c: Chaos resistance protects against confusion by
	chaos based attacks now.
	
	I hope that reduces the confusion about confusion effects from
	chaos attacks when you resist chaos, but not confusion.

2003-02-05 18:46  rr9

	* src/util.c: Try to output minor warning messages (such as
	"illegal option choice" when selecting a non existing item for a
	command) as soon as possible. (reported by "Mogami")

2003-02-04 19:59  rr9

	* src/spells2.c: Branding ammo or weapons will now automatically
	try to combine and reorder the resulting objects, even if the
	enchantment of to-hit and to-dam fails.  (reported by John D.
	Goulden)

2003-02-02 16:52  rr9

	* src/files.c: Changed the "Do you really want to quit?" prompt to
	"Do you really want to commit suicide?".

2003-02-02 15:40  rr9

	* src/cmd4.c: Mention the '? for help' command on the option screen
	prompt.

2003-02-02 13:09  rr9

	* src/util.c: Changed the behavior of the 'auto_more' option, so
	that it automatically skips '-more-' prompts instead of not
	displaying messages on the top line.  (Tom Houser)

2003-02-02 12:43  rr9

	* src/generate.c: The player can now get a level feeling when
	entering level 1 without spending 1000 game turns in town first.
	(Tom Houser)

2003-02-01 20:14  rr9

	* src/obj-info.c: Don't just show the content of books when
	'Inspecting' the.  Also show infos like "It cannot be harmed by the
	elements." just as for other item types.

2003-02-01 18:31  rr9

	* src/cmd2.c: Allow direct melee attacks on visible monsters in
	walls.	You still have to tunnel into the wall if you are trying to
	attack an invisible monster.  (suggested by Greg Stark)

2003-02-01 18:02  rr9

	* src/dungeon.c: You can now use either 'm' or 'p' to cast spells
	or pray.

2003-02-01 17:44  rr9

	* src/xtra2.c: Only print the "You feel (less) resistant to ..."
	messages when not immune to the specific element. (reported by
	"greenemail")

2003-02-01 14:59  rr9

	* src/lua/: declaration.lua, package.lua, tolua.h, tolua_gp.c,
	tolua_tt.c, tolualua.c, variable.lua: Tweaked the tolua code
	generation a bit to reduce the size of the output.

2003-01-30 20:10  rr9

	* src/: store.c, types.h: Increased the data-type of the shopkeeper
	purse limit from signed 16 bit to signed 32 bit.  This allows
	shopkeepers with a higher limit than 32768 gold.

2003-01-26 20:10  rr9

	* lib/edit/monster.txt, src/defines.h, src/init1.c,
	src/l-monst.pkg, src/monster1.c, src/spells1.c: Use the proper
	monster flags instead of workarounds for various resists and
	immunities.  This also allows the reporting of these flags in the
	monster recall and the spoilers. (thanks to Leon Marrick for
	pointing this out)
	
	Renamed some of the flags mentioned above to make them more
	readable in the source and the monster.txt file.
	
	Made the water vortex immune to water-based attacks.

2003-01-26 18:15  rr9

	* lib/edit/monster.txt, src/spells1.c: Use the Plasma-resist flag
	of monsters instead of the "plasma breathers resist plasma"
	workaround.

2003-01-26 15:55  rr9

	* src/: main-ami.c, main-cap.c, main-gcu.c, main-gtk.c, main-lsl.c,
	main-sla.c, main-vcs.c, main-win.c, main-x11.c, main-xaw.c: Only
	delay on TERM_XTRA_DELAY when the requested delay is >0.  This
	should speed up the Borg a lot on systems that end the timeslice of
	the process when calling "usleep(0)".

2003-01-26 15:38  rr9

	* angband.dsp, tolua.dsp: Accidently overwrote the MS VC++ project
	files in the commit of the Inno Setup script.  This restores the
	version that has been uploaded with Angband 3.0.3.

2003-01-25 21:17  rr9

	* angband.dsp, angband.iss, tolua.dsp: Added a Windows setup script
	using the free Inno Setup tool.

	changelog.

2003-01-25 17:29  rr9

	* lib/pref/: flvr-dvg.prf, graf-dvg.prf, xtra-dvg.prf: Removed some
	of the unused space from the 32x32 bitmap and changed the *.prf
	files accordingly.  The smaller bitmap should also fix the problem
	on older Windows versions with restrictions of the maximal bitmap
	size (Windows 95 and 98).
	
	The graphics (and the *.prf files) can be found at:
	ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/graf-dvg3.zip

2003-01-22 18:23  rr9

	* src/main-x11.c: Corrected a typo in a comment.

2003-01-15 21:58  rr9

	* configure.in: Fixed a problem with the CYGWIN conditional when
	using newer automake releases. (reported by Tormod Haugen) Lesson
	learned: Don't use AM_CONDITIONAL() conditionally since it *always*
	must be defined before using it.

2003-01-11 19:45  rr9

	* src/util.c: Fixed a bug in the text-output routines used for
	character dumps that sometimes introduced bogus output. (reported
	by Pasi Vartiainen)

2003-01-11 19:25  rr9

	* src/main-x11.c: Fixed a wrong entry in the template for the X11
	startup shell script.  ("Mynstral")

2003-01-11 18:57  rr9

	* src/obj-info.c: - Fixed the display of *slays* in character
	dumps. (Matthias Kurzke) - The "It might have hidden powers."
	message will now displayed in the   character dumps.  This makes it
	easier to see if an artifact or ego-item   with random abilities
	has already been *identified*.	- Curses on unidentified items are
	no longer revealed in character dumps	or in the output of the
	'Inspect' command.

2003-01-11 18:16  rr9

	* src/tables.c: Fixed a typo - "intellegence". (Greg Stark)

2002-12-22 17:57  rr9

	lib/edit/terrain.txt, lib/edit/vault.txt, lib/file/news.txt,
	lib/xtra/Makefile.am, lib/xtra/font/Makefile.am, src/defines.h: -
	Changed the version number for the upcoming 3.0.2 release.  -
	Include the 16x16.txt file in the source tarball and the
	installation.

2002-12-16 14:06  rr9

	* lib/pref/font-win.prf: Turned off the special floor symbols in
	the Windows port, since these seem to mess up the display on some
	newer Windows installations.

2002-12-16 13:55  rr9

	* src/cmd6.c: Use the simpler patch by Tormod Haugen for the rod
	stacking bugfix.

2002-12-16 13:44  rr9

	* src/cmd6.c: Zapping a stack of charging rods instantly recharged
	all but one of the stacked rods. (Tormod Haugen)

2002-12-16 13:38  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua: Fixed a problem with an undefined variable
	when zapping rods.

2002-12-16 12:45  rr9

	* src/object2.c: Only the top item in a stack was really destroyed
	by earthquake/destruction spells.  Other objects from the stack
	would reappear after saving/loading the game.  (reported by
	Matthias Kurzke) Today's lesson: Don't wipe objects that you are
	iterating over ...

2002-12-14 14:02  rr9

	* src/main-xpj.c: The XPJ port had a wrong filename in the
	header-comment.

2002-12-12 17:24  rr9

	* lib/edit/object.txt: - Replaced silver arrows and bolts with
	mithril ammo (no slay evil, a	little bit cheaper, light blue
	color).  Slay evil on non-ego ammo was too   powerful.	- Changed
	the color of seeker bolts to green since there are so many 'light  
	blue' ammo objects now.

2002-12-07 17:46  rr9

	* src/Makefile.lcc: Removed the reference to the unused lmathlib.c
	file.

2002-12-07 14:49  rr9

	* src/load.c: Fixed an off-by-one error that prevented savefiles
	with the maximum number of monsters (only possible in debug mode)
	from loading correctly. (Takeshi Mogami)

2002-12-06 23:30  rr9

	* src/lua/tolua.h: Removed the 'extern "C"' block from the tolua
	header.

2002-12-06 23:12  rr9

	* src/melee2.c: Removed two variables that are now unused.

2002-12-06 22:34  rr9

	* src/melee2.c: - Fixed an abuse that allowed the player to kill a
	monster with a ball spell   by staying out of sight and detection
	range of the monster while the	 monster just patiently waited
	without ever getting a turn. (reported by   Tormod Haugen)  
	Wounded monsters will now always get their turn, even when out of
	range.	- Cleaned up the code for deciding if a monster gets a
	turn.

2002-11-23 22:40  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, main.c, util.c, wizard2.c: Fixed various

	in the 'tolua' source - mainly missing 'const' qualifiers. (Andrew
	Sidwell)

2002-11-23 14:36  rr9

	* src/load.c: Fixed an off-by-one error in the savefile loading
	code.  The game reported "too many objects" when loading a savefile
	containing the maximum number of objects for a level.  That only
	could happen after heavy item creation in debug mode. (Takeshi
	Mogami)

2002-11-02 17:15  rr9

	* src/obj-info.c: Added a workaround for some compiler warnings
	about unused parameters.

2002-11-02 17:14  rr9

	* src/: dungeon.c, externs.h: Moved the prototypes for the DEBUG
	and BORG functions to externs.h.

2002-11-02 16:26  rr9

	* src/: main-x11.c, main-xaw.c: Use the "unified" '32x32.bmp' with
	the X11 and XAW ports.

2002-11-01 15:05  rr9

	* lib/pref/graf-win.prf, lib/xtra/graf/readme.txt, src/angband.rc,
	src/main-win.c, src/readdib.c, src/readdib.h: Added support for
	David Gervais' tiles to the Windows version.  Fixed a memory leak
	when switching between the various tilesets.

	* src/wizard2.c: Removed a compiler warning.

2002-10-20 17:10  rr9

2002-10-12 14:31  rr9

	* lib/edit/flavor.txt: 'Golden staves' had the wrong color - green.
	(John I'anson-Holton)

2002-10-12 13:15  rr9

	* src/files.c: Pressing Ctrl-C on the tombstone screen added a
	second highscore entry with "Killed by Abortion". (reported by
	Mauro Scarpa)

2002-10-11 21:24  rr9

	* lib/edit/artifact.txt: The Elfstone 'Elessar' and the Jewel
	'Evenstar' have the INSTA_ART flag now to make the APW-Borg happy.

2002-10-11 21:14  rr9

	* lib/edit/object.txt: Amulets of resistance are now fully known
	after identifying one for the first time. (Dr. Andrew White)

	allows modifying the player's state.

2002-09-22 11:25  rr9

	* lib/script/init.lua, src/l-misc.pkg, src/script.c: Moved the

	Sidwell)

2002-09-22 10:53  rr9

	* AUTHORS, COPYING, THANKS, TODO, compile.txt, readme.txt,

	static copies of the roff_top() function.

2002-09-08 12:58  rr9

	the character dump.  (Andrew Sidwell)

2002-09-08 12:53  rr9

	* src/util.c: Replaced text_out_to_file() with an improved version
	that respects the variables text_out_wrap and text_out_indent.
	(Antony Sidwell)

2002-09-07 13:49  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, h-config.h, h-define.h, h-system.h, main.c,
	script.c, util.c: Renamed the 'ACORN' #define to 'RISCOS'.

2002-09-06 20:06  rr9

	* src/: cmd3.c, cmd4.c, cmd5.c, defines.h, externs.h, l-object.pkg,
	load.c, obj-info.c, object1.c, object2.c, store.c, wizard1.c,
	wizard2.c: Added a flag to identify items that are currently in the
	inventory of a store.  This removes various ugly special cases.

2002-09-04 23:42  rr9

	to be easily redefined at compile time.

2002-09-04 23:37  rr9

	* src/init2.c: Simplify the initialization of the format() buffer.

2002-09-04 23:22  rr9

	* src/script.c: Variable arguments will be promoted according to
	standard C promotion rules.  Arguments of type 'char' or 'bool'
	will be promoted to 'int', and we should retrieve them as such.

2002-09-04 22:12  rr9

	* THANKS: Fixed a typo and updated the credits.

2002-08-31 21:33  rr9

	* src/: Makefile.am, Makefile.ami, Makefile.bcc, Makefile.cyg,
	Makefile.dos, Makefile.emx, Makefile.gtk, Makefile.ibm,
	Makefile.lcc, Makefile.lsl, Makefile.ros, Makefile.std,

2002-08-31 17:19  rr9

	* src/init1.c: Fixed a tiny typo in a comment.

2002-08-27 20:58  rr9

	* src/script.h: Added the missing prototype for leave_level_hook().

2002-08-27 19:06  rr9

	* src/init1.c: Removed an unused local variable. (Andrew Sidwell)

2002-08-27 18:59  rr9

	* src/script.c: The return types for spell names and info should be
	string, not integer.  (Andrew Sidwell)

2002-08-26 19:26  rr9

	* src/main-win.c: - The Windows port didn't use the cursor function
	for bigtile mode.  - Cleaned up the source a little bit.

2002-08-26 19:23  rr9

	* src/store.c: Added a missing #include.

2002-08-26 19:22  rr9

	* src/init2.c: Removed two unnecessary local variables.

2002-08-26 19:19  rr9

	* src/generate.c: Fixed an inversed test in the dungeon generation
	code that messed up level generation completely.

2002-08-24 19:39  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua, lib/script/spell.lua,
	lib/script/store.lua, src/birth.c, src/dungeon.c, src/generate.c,
	src/script.c, src/script.h: - Allowed boolean values to be used
	directly in the event handler code.  - The old callback functions
	use the new event-handler interface.  - Added events for
	entering/leaving a level, procesing a command, starting   the game,
	and generating a new dungeon level.

2002-08-24 14:31  rr9

	* lib/script/: birth.lua, event.lua: Allow multiple Lua event
	handlers per event.

2002-08-21 23:50  rr9

	* src/: birth.c, script.c, script.h: Reworked the Lua event handler
	again to get rid of the global array of return values.

2002-08-21 18:55  rr9

	* lib/script/event.lua, src/script.c: The extraction of results
	from calls to Lua hooks should work now.

2002-08-21 00:37  rr9

	* lib/script/event.lua, src/birth.c, src/script.c, src/script.h:
	Added a simplified version of the event-hook function from ToME to
	make the creation of event handlers easier.

2002-08-20 21:43  rr9

	* lib/script/Makefile.am, lib/script/birth.lua,
	lib/script/event.lua, lib/script/init.lua, src/birth.c,
	src/script.c, src/script.h: - Added basic event-handler code to
	call Lua functions when things happen	in the game.  - Moved the
	generation of the player's fixed starting equipment (food and  
	torches) to such an event handler.

2002-08-20 21:41  rr9

	* THANKS, TODO: Updated the ToDo list and added new contributors.

2002-08-20 21:00  rr9

	flushed to the screen immediatly.

2002-08-18 11:07  rr9

	* lib/script/init.lua: Access to an undefined global variable in
	Lua is now reported as an error.

2002-08-18 11:06  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua, src/externs.h, src/l-ui.pkg, src/util.c:
	The option for flushing of pending input when failing to cast a

	be installed.

2002-08-17 17:27  rr9

	* src/defines.h, src/init2.c, src/script.c, src/script.h,
	src/store.c, src/types.h, TODO, lib/script/init.lua,
	lib/script/store.lua: Moved the choice of items that stores will
	offer to a Lua script.

2002-07-29 13:54  rr9

	* lib/edit/flavor.txt, src/init1.c, src/util.c, src/z-util.c,
	src/z-util.h: The lib/edit/*.txt files can now optionally contain
	the names of the default object, monster, terrain, and flavor
	colors instead of just a character specifying the Angband color
	code.
	
	Changed the format of the flavor.txt file to make parsing easier.

2002-07-29 10:16  rr9

	* src/init2.c: Free the stored path to the script files at exit.

2002-07-28 21:16  rr9

	* lib/pref/flvr-dvg.prf, lib/pref/graf-dvg.prf,
	lib/pref/graf-x11.prf, lib/pref/xtra-dvg.prf, src/angband.rc,
	src/cave.c, src/cmd4.c, src/defines.h, src/externs.h,

	wizard mode resurrection -> double scores" problem.

2002-07-24 22:39  rr9

	* src/: main-x11.c, main-xpj.c: The X11 and XPJ versions will now
	exit properly if the font-loading in Infofnt_init_data() fails.

2002-07-20 16:26  rr9

	* src/: defines.h, object1.c, object2.c, xtra2.c: Limited the
	maximum size of floor stacks to 23, so that get_item() can always
	display a list containing all objects.

2002-07-20 15:00  rr9

	* src/cave.c: Removed two unused #defines.

2002-07-20 12:51  rr9

	* lib/edit/artifact.txt, lib/edit/object.txt, lib/help/dungeon.txt,
	lib/pref/graf-ibm.prf, lib/pref/graf-new.prf,

	src/object2.c, src/spells2.c, src/use-obj.c, src/wizard2.c,
	src/x-spell.c: Renamed 'genocide' to 'banishment' and 'mass
	genocide' to 'mass banishment' since that name fits much better to
	the effect.  The priest's 'banishment' spell has been renamed to
	'banish evil' to avoid confusion and since that is what it actually
	does.

2002-07-20 11:59  rr9

	conditional statements of the *.prf file format.

2002-07-20 11:56  rr9

	* src/load.c: Don't resurrect retired players to prevent multiple
	scorefile entries for the same character.

2002-07-16 21:48  rr9

	* src/dungeon.c: Starting the game with the -w wizard mode option
	and then answering 'no' at the 'enter wizard mode' prompt caused
	dead/retired characters to be scored several times.  The game now
	assumes the player really wants to enter wizard mode if he
	specifies -w and skips the prompt.

2002-07-13 16:47  rr9

	* lib/help/version.txt: The version.txt file refered to the 2.9.4

2002-07-11 23:57  rr9

	* src/xtra2.c: Check the panel-bounds more carefully to prevent

	* src/cave.c: Replaced some 'unsigned' variables and casts with
	normal 'ints'.

2002-07-11 21:58  rr9

	* src/: dungeon.c, main-ros.c, util.c, z-term.c, z-term.h: Changed

	* src/: dungeon.c, externs.h, generate.c, l-monst.pkg, melee2.c,
	monster2.c, save.c, spells2.c, variable.c, wizard2.c: Renamed
	'monster_max' and 'monster_cnt' again.	This time to the shorter
	'mon_max' and 'mon_cnt'.

2002-07-09 21:23  rr9

	* src/: cave.c, cmd1.c, cmd2.c, defines.h, dungeon.c, externs.h,

	* src/: dungeon.c, externs.h, generate.c, l-monst.pkg, melee2.c,
	monster2.c, save.c, spells2.c, variable.c, wizard2.c: Renamed m_cnt

2002-07-06 13:41  rr9

	* src/util.c: Removed another unnecessary use of 'uint'.

2002-07-06 13:31  rr9

	* src/object1.c: Removed some lint-warnings caused by unnecessary
	use of 'uint'.

2002-07-06 12:57  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, l-random.pkg, util.c: Changed the arguments and
	return values of damroll() and maxroll() to int.

2002-07-06 12:38  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, util.c: The build-in usleep() implementation now
	uses 'unsigned long' instead of 'huge' as it's argument.

2002-07-06 12:34  rr9

	* src/: z-form.c, z-form.h: Use size_t instead of 'huge' or 'uint'
	where appropriate.

2002-07-06 12:14  rr9

	* src/: main-mac.c, main-ros.c: Use the correct types for the
	memory allocation functions.

2002-07-06 11:51  rr9

	* src/: cave.c, cmd1.c, externs.h, h-type.h, l-object.pkg,
	melee2.c, object1.c, util.c, variable.c, xtra2.c: Removed the
	useless sint typedef.

2002-07-04 22:20  rr9

	* src/z-util.c: Fixed a typo in a comment.

2002-06-30 22:46  rr9

	* src/: birth.c, main-dos.c, main-gtk.c, main-win.c, main.c,
	monster1.c, script.c, util.c, z-form.c: Use my_strcpy() instead of
	strncpy().

2002-06-30 22:45  rr9

	* src/load.c: Removed a magic number for the length of the player
	name.

2002-06-30 22:44  rr9

	* src/: main-cap.c, main-lsl.c: More buffer overflow paranoia.

2002-06-30 22:41  rr9

	* src/files.c: Removed the 15 characters limitation for the
	character name.  The name can now be 31 characters long.  We may
	have to limit the 'base_name' on some platforms later to prevent
	filenames from getting too long, like we already do on DOS/Windows
	where base_name is restricted to 8 chars.

2002-06-30 22:01  rr9

	* src/xtra2.c: More paranoid buffer overflow checking.

2002-06-30 21:14  rr9

	* src/: cmd1.c, cmd2.c, cmd3.c, cmd4.c, cmd5.c, dungeon.c,
	externs.h, files.c, melee1.c, melee2.c, object1.c, object2.c,
	script.c, spells1.c, spells2.c, store.c, use-obj.c, wizard1.c,
	wizard2.c, xtra2.c: Added a buffer size parameter to object_desc().

2002-06-30 19:28  rr9

	* src/: cmd1.c, cmd2.c, externs.h, l-monst.pkg, melee1.c, melee2.c,
	monster2.c, spells1.c, spells2.c, xtra2.c: Added a buffer-length
	argument to the monster_desc() function to prevent buffer overruns.

2002-06-30 19:07  rr9

	* src/: files.c, main-emx.c, main-ros.c, main.c, object1.c, util.c,
	wizard1.c, z-util.c, z-util.h: - Added a my_strcat() function that
	behaves like strlcat() from BSD.  - Used the new function instead
	of strcat() to prevent several possible   buffer overflows.

2002-06-30 17:53  rr9

	* src/: cmd1.c, cmd3.c, cmd4.c, cmd5.c, externs.h, files.c,
	init2.c, load.c, main-gtk.c, main-x11.c, main-xaw.c, main-xpj.c,
	main.c, monster1.c, object1.c, randart.c, save.c, spells1.c,
	store.c, util.c, wizard1.c, wizard2.c, xtra2.c: Fixed various
	potential buffer overflows.

2002-06-30 15:53  rr9

	* src/z-form.c: Removed the code for the unused format-string
	sequences "%r" and "%v".

2002-06-29 14:10  rr9

	* src/: z-util.c, z-util.h: Added a my_strcpy() function that
	behaves like strlcpy() in BSD.	Unlike strncpy() it always
	NUL-terminates the buffer, preventing buffer overflows.

2002-06-24 19:55  rr9

	* src/birth.c: Fixed several possible buffer overflows.  The code
	for generating the player history was especially vulnerable
	(reported by Eytan Zweig).  None of the overflows were directly
	security relevant.  The player-history overflow could have been
	abused to turn Angband into a trojan horse if the attacker already
	gained priviledged access to group 'games' by other means.

2002-06-23 14:30  rr9

	* src/x-spell.c: Removed the DOS-style CR/LFs from the x-spell.c
	file.

2002-06-23 14:07  rr9

	* compile.txt: Added basic instructions for compiling Angband with
	the lcc-win32 compiler.

2002-06-23 12:06  rr9

	* src/Makefile.lcc: Updated the Makefile for the lcc-win32
	compiler.  (Re)building the Lua wrappers with tolua is not yet
	supported, so compiling only works is the l-*.c files already exist
	(like when using the source tarballs of official releases).

2002-06-22 19:48  rr9

	* src/main-ros.c: Replaced some hard-coded buffer size values with
	sizeof(buffer).

2002-06-22 19:44  rr9

	* src/: Makefile.ami, Makefile.bcc, Makefile.cyg, Makefile.dos,
	Makefile.gtk, Makefile.ibm, Makefile.lsl, Makefile.ros,
	Makefile.std: Added x-spell.o and use-obj.o to various Makefiles
	and fixed some missing dependencies.

2002-06-22 19:37  rr9

	* src/main-ros.c: my_strnicmp() in main-ros.c was quite buggy.
	(Hallvard B. Furuseth)

2002-06-22 19:16  rr9

	* src/cmd2.c: Made the buffer for the input of the number of turns
	to rest smaller and used sizeof() instead of the hardcoded array
	size.

2002-06-22 19:10  rr9

	* src/: cmd3.c, cmd4.c, files.c, init2.c, load.c, main-dos.c,
	main-gtk.c, main-ibm.c, main-lsl.c, main-mac.c, main-ros.c,
	main-vme.c, main-win.c, main-x11.c, main-xaw.c, main-xpj.c, main.c,
	object1.c, script.c, store.c, util.c, wizard1.c, z-form.c: Replaced
	various hardcoded magic numbers for buffer-sizes with sizeof(buf).

2002-06-22 17:23  rr9

	* src/: h-define.h, h-system.h, util.c: Introduced UN_KTRL() to
	match KTRL().  This improves charset-independence.  (Hallvard B.
	Furuseth)

2002-06-22 17:13  rr9

	* src/: files.c, main-ros.c, main-win.c: Be more paranoid about
	buffer overruns when dealing with filenames.  (Hallvard B.
	Furuseth)

2002-06-22 16:32  rr9

	* src/: cmd4.c, defines.h, tables.c: Made an OPT_NONE constant for
	the magic constant option_page[][] == 255.  (Hallvard B. Furuseth)

2002-06-22 15:43  rr9

	* src/: birth.c, cmd4.c, cmd5.c, files.c, h-define.h, main-ami.c,
	main-dos.c, main-ros.c, main-vme.c, main-win.c, main-xpj.c, main.c,
	object1.c, randart.c, store.c, util.c, xtra2.c, z-form.c: The
	islower(), isupper(), ... and the tolower() and toupper() functions
	take an 'int' as the argument but actually expect it to be an
	'unsigned char' or EOF.  We now cast the argument to 'unsigned
	char' to prevent breakage with 8-bit character data on hosts where
	'char' is signed.  (based on the patch by Hallvard B. Furuseth)

2002-06-22 15:20  rr9

	* src/z-util.c: strlen() returns size_t, not int.

2002-06-22 13:22  rr9

	* src/main-sla.c: Changed "SLang" to "S-Lang" in some error
	messages. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)

2002-06-22 11:55  rr9

	* src/files.c: Fixed an off-by-one error when checking if playing
	Angband is allowed at this time of day. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)

2002-06-22 11:21  rr9

	* src/main-gtk.c: Reordered the code for creating the GTK-windows
	to prevent false compiler warnings about missing initializations.

2002-06-22 10:48  rr9

	* src/: z-virt.c, z-virt.h: Cleaned up the memory allocation
	functions and macros a bit.  Removed some useless casts, changed
	vptr to void*, and replaced an "optimized" strcpy() implementation
	with the function from the standard library.

2002-06-22 10:34  rr9

	* src/object1.c: Some comments referenced to the old strfmt()
	function. (Kieron Dunbar)

2002-06-16 22:58  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua: Fixed the array-index in the activation
	routine for 'The Shield of Deflection of Gil-galad'.

2002-06-16 22:56  rr9

	* src/l-spell.pkg: Added the strong_lite_line() spell effect to the
	Lua interface.

2002-06-09 19:34  rr9

	* src/files.c: Removed an unused variable.

2002-06-08 20:18  rr9

	* src/main-ami.c: Adjusted the internal version number of the Amiga
	version.

2002-06-07 21:49  rr9

	* src/Makefile.ros: Removed an old workaround for getting Lua to
	compile on Risc OS machines.

2002-06-07 21:41  rr9

	* src/: Makefile.bcc, Makefile.cyg, Makefile.dos, Makefile.gtk,
	Makefile.ibm, Makefile.lsl, Makefile.ros, Makefile.std,
	angband.dsp, tolua.dsp, lua/Makefile.am, lua/Makefile.ami,
	lua/ltests.c: Removed a Lua file that isn't actually used by
	Angband.

2002-06-07 11:12  rr9

	* src/files.c: The changes to the character history introduced a
	bug that caused object- infos in the character dump to be sent to
	the screen instead of to the chardump file. (Andrew Sidwell)

2002-06-07 10:11  rr9

	* src/wizard1.c: Show the 'cursed' flag of artifacts in the
	spoilers. (KUSUNOSE Toru)

2002-06-07 10:02  rr9

	* src/: defines.h, object2.c, tables.c: Fixed a bug that allowed
	changes to the birth option 'birth_no_stacking' to affect the
	current game. (KUSUNOSE Toru)

2002-06-06 21:55  rr9

	* changes.txt: Removed an outdated changelog entry about the
	GWAngband spellbooks.

2002-06-01 17:05  rr9

	* src/: defines.h, dungeon.c, externs.h, l-monst.pkg, melee2.c,
	monster2.c, variable.c: Removed the MFLAG_BORN flag, since it
	doesn't seem to do anything useful.

2002-06-01 17:00  rr9

	* src/main-gcu.c: Added bigscreen support to main-gcu.c. (pelpel)

2002-06-01 16:41  rr9

	* src/object2.c: Light-sources can now become ego-items.

2002-06-01 15:16  rr9

	* lib/edit/artifact.txt, lib/edit/cost_adj.txt,
	lib/edit/ego_item.txt, lib/edit/flavor.txt, lib/edit/limits.txt,
	lib/edit/monster.txt, lib/edit/object.txt, lib/edit/p_class.txt,
	lib/edit/p_hist.txt, lib/edit/p_race.txt, lib/edit/shop_own.txt,

	src/birth.c, src/defines.h, src/files.c, src/load.c, src/save.c,
	src/types.h: Simplified the player history from char[4][60] to
	char[250].  Increased the version number to 3.0.1 since the change
	required a tiny modification of the savefile format.

2002-06-01 15:10  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, util.c, variable.c: Extend the
	text_out_to_screen() hook for text_out() with configurable
	indentation and word-wrap boundary.

2002-05-30 21:27  rr9

	* src/: Makefile.ros, externs.h, main-ros.c, script.c: Added the
	Angband 3.0 patch for RISC OS. (Antony Sidwell)

2002-05-30 18:05  rr9

	* src/main-win.c: Make "bizarre display" the default in the Windows
	version since Windows XP seems to have strange problems to display
	the floor characters and messes up the display completely without
	that option turned on.

2002-05-30 15:23  rr9

	* compile.txt: Mention the ext-*-300.zip files in the compile
	guide.

2002-05-30 14:57  rr9

	* src/lua/: llimits.h, lopcodes.h: Moved some #defines in the Lua
	headers.  That should solve the circular includes problem with the
	RISC OS compiler.

2002-05-30 12:07  rr9

	* src/main-gcu.c: The initscr() function returns NULL on error (or
	causes the program to exit).

2002-05-30 12:04  rr9

	* src/script.c: Removed an unused local variable.

2002-05-25 14:04  rr9

	* THANKS: Updated the credits.	There are probably many
	contributors that I missed - please report any missing entries.

2002-05-25 13:54  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua, src/use-obj.c: Activating a Ring of
	Acid/Flames/Ice/Lightning showed the "You feel resistant to xxxx"
	message twice. (KUSUNOSE Toru)

2002-05-25 13:41  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua: The activation of the balance DSM can now
	have the disenchantment effect (bug reported by  KUSUNOSE Toru).

2002-05-20 18:57  rr9

	* src/: config.h, script.c: Don't allow the user to execute his own
	scripts in debug mode on multiuser systems.  The scripting code has
	not yet been reviewed for possible security problems with a setgid
	executable.

2002-05-15 20:24  rr9

	* src/: files.c, main-emx.c, main-mac.c, main-ros.c, main.c:
	Adjusted the calls to pause_line() function to use the last line of
	the screen instead of the fixed value - line 23.

2002-05-15 20:17  rr9

	* src/cmd2.c: Forgot one file in the last commit.

2002-05-15 20:13  rr9

	* src/: cmd1.c, externs.h, melee1.c: Merged the various different
	test_hit_*() and check_hit() functions into a single function.

2002-05-12 18:12  rr9

	* src/: cave.c, cmd3.c, externs.h, variable.c, xtra2.c: Changed the
	Angband sort function to use void* directly instead of the 'vptr'
	typedef and const'ified the comparision functions.

2002-05-12 15:12  rr9

	* src/h-type.h: Removed the typedef for 'real' (double).  Fixed a
	typo in a comment.  Removed a (false?) comment about 'signed char'
	being possibly "illegal" on some machines.

2002-05-12 00:34  rr9

	* src/load.c: Declared some local functions as 'static' to reduce
	namespace pollution.

2002-05-12 00:25  rr9

	* src/init2.c: Free the player-class info when exiting the program.

2002-05-12 00:03  rr9

	to Angband 2.8.0.

2002-05-10 18:14  rr9

	* src/: config.h, monster1.c: Removed the unused or broken
	DELAY_LOAD_*_TEXT defines.

2002-05-09 20:07  rr9

	* src/lua/: ldo.c, lparser.c: Worked around a name conflict caused
	by CodeWarrior. (pelpel)

2002-05-09 19:54  rr9

	* src/h-system.h: Recent CodeWarrior releases require <unistd.h>
	and <fcntl.h> for Angband to compile. (pelpel)

2002-05-09 14:35  rr9

	* lib/edit/artifact.txt: Added the HIDE_TYPE flag to the
	'Wormtongue' boots since the name is too long otherwise.  Removed
	the flag from 'Ringil' since it looks better with (+10 to speed)
	and speed is it's only pval-related flag.

2002-05-09 14:28  rr9

	* lib/edit/ego_item.txt: Changed the levels of some of the cursed
	ego-items so they will actually be generated.

2002-05-05 14:18  rr9

	* lib/script/object.lua: Fixed an 'off by one' error in the
	determination of the object level when using wands and rods.  The
	wrong object was used to determine the level.

2002-05-05 12:39  rr9

	* lib/edit/object.txt: Reordered the magic books so that they are
	ordered by level in the player's inventory.  This also fixes the
	differences between the name of the books and the content.

2002-05-05 00:47  rr9

	* src/object1.c: "I"nspecting items with the KILL_UNDEAD flag said
	"It is a great bane of undeads".  Changed that to "It is a great
	bane of the undead.".

2002-05-04 15:43  rr9

	* src/init2.c: Don't try to generate "Resistances of Scarabtarices"
	in the magic store.

2002-04-27 20:14  rr9

	* src/x-spell.c: Updated the non-Lua spellcode to the latest
	changes.  Note that the order of spells in some books is not
	correct due to the limitations of the old non-Lua spell-code.

2002-04-27 18:11  rr9

	* lib/: edit/p_class.txt, script/spell.lua: Exchanged the fire- and
	acid-bolt spells.

2002-04-27 14:29  rr9

	* lib/edit/monster.txt: Toned down some monsters (Will o' the wisp,
	Aranea, Elder aranea, Barbazu) as recommended by Jonathan Ellis.

	* src/cmd4.c: The option screen now understands 'y' and 'n' when
	using roguelike keys.

2002-04-13 13:05  rr9

	lib/edit/terrain.txt, lib/edit/vault.txt, lib/file/news.txt,
	src/defines.h: Changed the version number to 3.0.0.  Cleaned up the
	changelog.

2002-04-13 12:46  rr9

	* configure.in: Automake isn't clever enough to notice that
	config.sub and config.guess are required and should be installed
	when '--add-missing' is requested. So we have to give it a hint by
	using AC_CHECK_TOOL.

2002-04-08 20:34  rr9

	* src/cmd5.c: Removed an useless variable initialization.

2002-04-08 17:21  rr9

	* src/cmd4.c: The roguelike keyset can now be used for navigation
	on the options screen.

2002-04-08 16:21  rr9

	'Identify' spell.

2002-04-08 12:45  rr9

	* lib/script/spell.lua, src/x-spell.c: Added GW's "meteor swarm"
	spell.

2002-04-08 12:39  rr9

	* src/: externs.h, l-spell.pkg, spells2.c: Added the fire_swarm()
	function from GWAngband that allows firing multiple ball spells at
	the same target.

2002-04-03 17:03  rr9

	* lib/script/spell.lua: Cleaned up the spellcasting code.

2002-04-02 15:42  rr9

	object-activations undefined when an error occurs.

2002-04-02 14:46  rr9

	player-spell flags.  Increased the version number.

2002-03-23 23:58  rr9

	* src/x-spell.c: Added the non-Lua version of the GWAngband
	spellsystem (Jagath Samarabandu).

2002-03-23 23:44  rr9

	* src/Makefile.am: Added the non-Lua spelldefinitions to the
	distribution.

	* lib/edit/object.txt: Silver bolts ignore fire just as silver
	arrows do.

2002-03-23 23:31  rr9

	were declared as 'int' even though they   were read() in and
	written as single-byte entities.    (That would "accidentally" work
	on little-endian hosts.)  - init_vcs() was defined with no args but
	declared and called with 2   args.  - coredump if ttyname() failed:
	NULL pointer would be followed.  - fix a file descriptor leak if
	init_vcs() failed.
